Test2.java was my initial code. This code prints out steps 1-8

number1.java did step 1
number2.java did step 2
number3.java did step 3
number4.java did step 4
number5.java did step 5
number6.java did step 6
number7.java did step 7
number8.java did step 8

number7 and number8's algorithm feels off.
I also made a small Test.txt file to test me code in the beginning.
